A powerful elven sorcerer who betrayed his people for forbidden magic.

## Description

Eldrin was once a respected member of the High Elven Council, but his obsession with forbidden shadow magic led to his exile. He now seeks to open the Shadow Gate, a portal to the realm of darkness, in order to gain unlimited power.

His silver hair has darkened to an unnatural black, and his once-bright eyes now glow with an eerie purple light. Runes of dark magic are tattooed across his skin, pulsing with power when he casts spells.

## Relations

**Allies:** The Forsaken Order, Shadow Cultists
**Enemies:** The party, The High Elven Council, The Order of Light

## Current Schemes

Eldrin is currently searching for the three Shadow Keys needed to unlock the Shadow Gate. He has already obtained one from the ruins of Eldoria and knows the location of the second in the Frostpeak Mountains.
