## Lore

Shadow Behemoths are not natural creatures but rather manifestations of shadow energy given form by powerful spellcasters. They exist only to consume light and life, returning all to the primordial darkness from which they were summoned.

The one encountered by the party was particularly powerful, having been strengthened by the ambient energy of the Shadow Gate. Its defeat was only possible due to the Sunstone Amulet, an artifact specifically created to combat creatures of pure shadow.

- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- Cannot enter areas of bright magical light
- Becomes disoriented if its Engulfing Darkness is dispelled
